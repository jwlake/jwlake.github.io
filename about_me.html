                My name is Justin Lake, and I am currently 22 years old studying computer science. My goal is to become a software developer or something similar. This is my first dip into coding so I hope to explore this more and become better at it. I am pretty much a nerd, I enjoy videogames, I love going to the movies, I enjoy watching anime, I love watching sports; my favorite to watch being the NHL. My favorite videogame of all time is Elden Ring, to me that is the pinnacle of gaming and I enjoyed it thoroughly.
                I am into sci-fi movies a lot, I love the star wars movies but I am also heavily into fantasy movies, I love The Lord of the Rings and one of my favorite shows to watch is Game of Thrones. I have a few favorite anime, my most favorite is One piece, but a close few others include Code Geass, and Bleach. I enjoy sports a lot, growing up I played sports all my life from soccer, to ice hockey to football and in highschool I ran track and field. I hope this was able to give you a glimpse into my life and teach you a little about myself!
